#### Description

The AR enabled home styler application allows user to place furniture objects virtually with the help of user device camera. We have used Google AR
Core ground detection functionality which enables the app to detect horizontal surfaces at which the user points the device. Then the user will be able to select furniture models from a slider provided and can place them on the detected ground surface with screen touch gestures. User is also able to rotate, translate furniture along the detected ground plane. Along with that, User can also reomve furnitures , change textures with the UI buttons provided. The 
app is lightweight as we used AWS cloud storage to store the assets. Also user can see the individual furniture information such as seller, desription, price ,
dimensions, materials used in making etc. Also, app provides ui for taking screenshots and has in built gallery.
